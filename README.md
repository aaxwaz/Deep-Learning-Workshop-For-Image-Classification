# NUS Deep Learning workshop in Computer Vision
Build am image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow

Files structure: 

1. Training customerized CNN from scratch, run command line below 

```python train.py --trainDir /dir/to/download/and/load/data/from/ --savedSessionDir /dir/to/save/your/model/session/```

Dependencies: 

```
configuration - model architecture configuration 
build_graph - main graph building for CNN model 
data_utils - utils functions to download, save and load data 
vis_utils - util functions to visualize hidden / activation layers 
```

2. Main tutorials for hands-on image classification - using CNN from scratch as well as pre-trained models such as VGG and Inception V3
